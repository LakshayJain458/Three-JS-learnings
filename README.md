## Overview

This repository contains the code and resources for five projects that I built while learning Three.js. Each project is designed to explore different aspects of Three.js, from basic scene creation to more complex effects and physics integration.

## Projects

### 1. Basic Project 1

This is the introductory project where I familiarized myself with the basics of Three.js, including setting up a scene, camera, and renderer. This project serves as the foundation for the more advanced projects that follow.

**Features:**
- Basic scene setup
- Simple geometries and materials
- Basic animations

### 2. Creating Earth

In this project, I created a 3D model of Earth. The project includes a textured sphere representing the Earth, with realistic lighting and rotation effects.

**Features:**
- Textured sphere
- Realistic lighting
- Rotational animation

### 3. Fly Through a Wireframe Wormhole

This project simulates a fly-through experience in a wireframe wormhole. The effect is achieved using dynamic geometry and animation techniques.

**Features:**
- Dynamic wireframe geometry
- Fly-through animation
- Camera manipulation

### 4. Transition Effect

In this project, I implemented a transition effect between two scenes. The transition is smooth and visually appealing, showcasing the ability to switch between different scenes seamlessly.

**Features:**
- Scene transitions
- Smooth animations
- Shader effects

### 5. Adding Physics with Rapier

This project integrates the Rapier physics engine with Three.js to add realistic physics to the scene. Objects interact with each other based on physical principles like gravity and collisions.

**Features:**
- Physics integration with Rapier
- Realistic object interactions
- Dynamic simulations
